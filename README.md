# K Nearest Neighbour using Python
In this repository, I have shown a simple kNN example which helps classify things. In this example, I have used 7 variables/parameters to predict the outcome as an integer ranging from 1 to 6.

## Implementation using Maths in python for 6 categories:
In this, we will be dealing with an example which helps to classify 6 different types of plastics based on their composition of 7 elements whose percentage are given in test_X.csv and outcome in test_Y.csv.

We will be training our dataset on the model and then use it to predict the type of plastics for other datasets.
